# Use nanoCUL device for wMBus reception with wmbusmeters

nanoCUL is a USB wMBus interface based on Arduino Nano (or a clone) and CC1101 module. You can build one yourself with a little bit of tinkering skills or buy a finished unit from one of the vendors. You'll probably want a 868 MHz version for wMBus. It supports both C1 and T1 modes with the correct firmware. The device you have likely requires a firmware upgrade, unless your vendor flashed it with software that you requested.

This guide will help you to flash your nanoCUL device with a firmware that works nicely with wmbusmeters.

There is also [every-culfw](https://github.com/DecksLabs/every-culfw/tree/main/docs) that uses Arduino Every and has much bigger buffer size (1500 bytes) so you shouldn't hit the buffer size limit that easily. Everything except for firmware and flashing from this guide is common for nanoCUL and everyCUL.

## Firmware

The Arduino Nano is an ATmega328P based device that requires a firmware. If you buy a commercially available nanoCUL device chances are that it has either a firmware that does not support wMBus, does not support C1 mode or has a too small TTY buffer for longer wMBus frames. So you might have to flash the firmware for your nanoCUL even if you bought a ready device.

There are two firmwares available for a nanoCUL: the original [culfw](http://culfw.de/culfw.html) and a modified version of it called [a-culfw](https://github.com/heliflieger/a-culfw). You can build the firmware yourself from the source code but that's outside the scope of this guide. The firmware provided on this page is created based on the last available release of culfw (r568) since that offers support for wMBus C1 mode too. The wMBus mode consumes quite a lot of memory and the ATmega328P does not have a lot so any extra radio modes supported by the culfw were disabled. Some wMBus telegrams are quite lengthy, so the standard receive buffer size (TTY_BUFSIZE parameter in board.h) was increased to 300 bytes. This enables you to receive 148 byte long wMBus telegrams. 

Firmware can be downloaded here:
[nanoCUL_r568_mbus_c1t1_bufsize300.zip](https://github.com/weetmuts/wmbusmeterswiki/files/7623213/nanoCUL_r568_mbus_c1t1_bufsize300.zip)

A board.h file is provided, in case you're interested in looking at the options used or want to modify the firmware. If you want to do that, download the culfw [firmware tarball](https://sourceforge.net/code-snapshots/svn/c/cu/culfw/code/culfw-code-r568-trunk.zip) and replace the board.h in culfw/Devices/nanoCUL folder and run make in that folder.

### Flashing

I have flashed my nanoCUL on a Linux system (be it a PC or a Raspberry Pi, the installation is similar) running Ubuntu-like operating system. First thing you need to do is to install the avrdude software that can be used for flashing. It's also available for Windows command line but I have not tried it.

```sudo apt install avrdude```

Now plug in your nanoCUL device to your USB port and make sure you see the USB serial adapter of the nanoCUL:

```
$ lsusb
Bus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub
Bus 001 Device 006: ID 0403:6001 Future Technology Devices International, Ltd FT232 Serial (UART) IC
Bus 001 Device 002: ID 2109:3431 VIA Labs, Inc. Hub
Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
```

Mine has the FT232 serial adapter that's readily supported by Linux. Since I don't have any other USB serial adapters my device name is /dev/ttyUSB0:

```
$ ls -l /dev/ttyUSB*
crw-rw---- 1 root dialout 188, 0 Nov 29 20:53 /dev/ttyUSB0
```

Now it's time to flash the firmware. Place the hex file into your Linux machine and run avrdude using your device name and the filename of the firmware like this:

```
$ avrdude -D -p atmega328p -P /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 115200 -c arduino -U flash:w:nanoCUL_r568_mbus_c1t1_bufsize300.hex

```

## Initial verification

Now that you have your stick flashed you can use it with wmbusmeters. Easiest is to run wmbusmeters from the command line and make it print all diagrams it receives. Here's an example command that makes nanoCUL listen to all C1 frames and print them (change c1 for t1 if your wMBus meter transmits in T1 mode):

```

Press Ctrl-C to stop the execution. There are a few important points you can learn from this printout.

wmbusmeters was able to connect to the nanoCUL and the firmware r568 is running on it:

```
(cul) probe response "V 1.67 nanoCUL868_r568<0D><0A>"
(serialtty) closed /dev/ttyUSB0 (detect cul)
(cul) are you there? yes
```

The nanoCUL firmware supports C1 mode:

```
(cul) received "CMODE"(serial /dev/ttyUSB0) sent "5832310A0D"
```

wmbusmeters is listening to everything it can hear:

```
No meters configured. Printing id:s of all telegrams heard!
```

And finally we can see that the nanoCUL has received something and wmbusmeters is able to tell that this particular frame was coming from Zenner water meter. Everything looks good and your nanoCUL is working!

Now you can proceed configuring wmbusmeters normally and set up your meters.

## nanoCUL vendors

I bought my nanoCUL from a company called [smart-home-komponente.de](https://www.smart-home-komponente.de/nano-cul/nano-cul-868/). I've also provided them with the firmware I created for myself, so perhaps they can flash it for you on purchase. I get no incentive in mentioning them here.

## Troubleshooting

### TTY Buffer Too Small

If you do get an error such as:

```
(cul) bad hex "6644496A106403551437C5337251345015496A00073B005005CE0607C429BAC37E8E51209BAEA0F3B6DEC8F47487DB9697D3760960AFA2E53813F0ED9B555AEBC7CD9EEAF9AE50AA5555C8F256F701D35F21D72DAAFE161E83E91B994AA5AE2C74210775B3E44BF5E8FC49091"
(cul) warning: the hex string is not proper! Ignoring telegram!
(cul) error in received message.
```

This likely means that the wMBus telegram was larger than what can be fit into the TTY buffer of the nanoCUL. The firmware linked here has a buffer size of 300 bytes that's about the maximum I could fit in the small RAM. It should be possible to receive a wMBus telegram of 148 bytes with this firmware.

If you want to grow the buffer size and compile your new firmware modify this line in board.h before compiling:

```
#define TTY_BUFSIZE             300
```

### avrdude Fails Verification of Flash

For some reason avrdude was giving me verification errors such as the one below often when flashing. I simply retried until I did not get errors. The stick seemed to work even with those errors though.

```

### stk500_recv(): programmer is not responding Error When Flashing

Many guides tell you to use baud rate of 57600 bps but I got *stk500_recv(): programmer is not responding* errors unless I changed the baud rate to 115200 on the avrdude command.

```
$ avrdude -D -p atmega328p -P /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 57600 -c arduino -U flash:w:nanoCUL_r568_mbus_c1t1_bufsize300.hex
