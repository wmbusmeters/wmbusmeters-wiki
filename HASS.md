Add MQTT send command to config file /etc/wmbusmeters.conf
```
shell=/usr/bin/mosquitto_pub -h localhost -t wmbusmeters/"$METER_ID" -m "$METER_JSON"
```

Add sensor configuration to Home Assistant configuration file (as example for water meter readings).
Change the topic to match the meter id.

```
mqtt:
  sensor:
    - name: "meter_name"
      state_topic: "wmbusmeters/12345678"
      unit_of_measurement: "mÂ³"
      device_class: water
